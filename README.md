Sudoku solver:

I will most likely be making this into an app. The majority of the coding will take place in Java. I may make a web implementation of this. However, the module that solves the Sudoku puzzle will take in a two dimensional array of the unsolved puzzle and spit out an array of the solved puzzle. If the puzzle is not solvable, it will spit out a NULL reference instead. The point of me constructing it this way is that I will be able to make a more flexible web-based or android-based user interface.
